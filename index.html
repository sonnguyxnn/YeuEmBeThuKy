            <p>My Dearest Em Bé Thư Kỳ,</p>

            <p>Every day, I find myself falling more in love with you, and I often wonder how I could be so lucky to have you by my side. From the moment we met, my world has been brighter, my days filled with more laughter, and my heart warmer than I ever thought possible.</p>

            <p>I still remember our first date like it was yesterday, the way your eyes sparkled in the light, the sound of your laughter echoing in my ears. I knew then that I had found someone truly special, someone who would change my life forever. And here we are, sharing dreams, planning adventures, and making memories that I will cherish for a lifetime.</p>

            <p>There are so many things I love about you: the way you care so deeply for those around you, the passion you bring to everything you do, and the way you make even the simplest moments feel extraordinary. You have a kindness and a strength that inspire me every day. With you, I feel complete, as though every missing piece has finally found its place.</p>

            <p>As we look ahead to all the days to come, I can't help but feel excited for the future. I know that whatever challenges we may face, we will face them together, hand in hand, heart to heart. I promise to always be there for you, to support you in your dreams, and to love you with all that I am, every single day.</p>

            <p>Thank you for being my partner, my confidante, my best friend, and the love of my life. I can't wait to continue this beautiful journey with you, to create countless more memories, and to grow even deeper in love with you. You are my everything, and I am so incredibly grateful to share this life with you.</p>

            <p>Forever yours,</p>
            <p>Your Dav ❤️</p>
